# Rekwarfare engine

(I like to call it the RW Engine)

A 2D game engine that utilizes SDL2 and OpenGL.

## What is it for?

Ideally, any 2D game that doesn't need best-of-the-industry-features-and-tech.

## What are its features?

Not much, I'm developing this to be very generic and "barebones"-ish. It can
do the following:

* Handle SDL Windows
* Render textures
* Play audio
* Run a server (to be rewritten soon!)

# Dependencies

[OpenGL](https://opengl.org/)

[SDL2](http://libsdl.org/)

[SDL2_image](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)

[SDL2_ttf](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)

[SDL2_mixer](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)

# Building

Building is pretty simple, feel free to modify the CMakeLists.txt to fit your needs.

I currently only know how to build on GNU/Linux systems...

## Linux

Pretty simple, just clone repository, have a separate directory to have build files, then build from that directory.

So following the instructions, you should do something like this:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rodrun/rekwarfare-engine.git
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake <wherever rekwarfare-engine repository is>
$ make
```

# Starting off

I try my best to make the engine very simple to use. To get a window started up and running you can do the following:

```
using namespace rekwarfare;
// Feel free to change any of these parameters
initializeSDL(INIT_EVERYTHING, IMG_PNG, MIX_MP3);
Window window("A window!", WINDOWPOS_UNDEF, WINDOWPOS_UNDEF, 800, 400);
initializeOpenGL(window());
while (window.isRunning()) {
    while (window.getEventPollingState() != 0) {
        window.pollWindowEvents();
        switch (window.e) {
            // Check for some events
        }
    }
    window.clear();
    // Do some stuff here
    window.update();
}
```

**Remember** that everything is within the namespace 'rekwarfare'.

Please see the documentation for more. (to be written soon!)

**Possible things to keep in mind:**

I *believe* that, due to the way I've created the 'Window' class so far, you may only be allowed to use one window, and only one. This is because the window calls the necessary functions to initialize SDL and other things. This may change soon.
