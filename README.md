# Rekwarfare engine

A 2D game engine that utilizes SDL2 and OpenGL.

## What is it for?

Ideally, any 2D game that doesn't need best-of-the-industry-features-and-tech.

## What are its features?

Not much, I'm developing this to be very generic and "barebones"-ish. It can
do the following:

* Handle SDL Windows
* Render textures
* Play audio
* Run a server
